This Product Requirements Document (PRD) is designed for Sentinel AI, a universal security researcher built for the Gemini 3 Flash Developer Challenge. It focuses on technical depth, cross-stack reasoning, and automated exploit verification.
PRD: Sentinel AI – Universal Security Auditor
1. Executive Summary
Sentinel AI is an agentic security platform that leverages the 1M+ token context window of Gemini 3 Flash to perform holistic audits across Web2 (APIs/Frontend), Web3 (Smart Contracts), and DLT (Consensus/Core) layers. Unlike static analyzers, it generates functional Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and localized test environments to prove vulnerabilities.
2. Target Audience
 * Security Researchers: Hunting for high-value bounties on Immunefi/HackerOne.
 * Web3 Developers: Needing pre-deployment "Zero-Day" stress testing.
 * Protocol DAOs: Requiring continuous monitoring of cross-chain bridges and logic.
3. Use Cases & User Stories
A. Use Case: The Cross-Stack "Chain of Infection"
 * User Story: As a bug hunter, I want to see if an insecure Web2 API endpoint can be manipulated to drain a Web3 Vault.
 * Requirement: The system must map data flow from .env files and Express.js routes to Solidity/Rust entry points.
B. Use Case: Automated PoC Generation
 * User Story: As an auditor, I need a ready-to-run Foundry test file to submit my findings to a bug bounty platform.
 * Requirement: Gemini must output syntactically correct test code (.t.sol or .test.ts) that reproduces the exploit state.
4. Functional Requirements
FR.1: Context Ingestion (Multi-Stack)
 * Support for recursive directory scanning of TypeScript, Rust, Go, Solidity, and Move.
 * Ability to parse project configuration files (foundry.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod) to understand environment dependencies.
FR.2: Vulnerability Detection Engine
 * Pattern Matching: Known vulnerabilities (Reentrancy, Arithmetic Overflow, Logic errors).
 * Zero-Day Logic Reasoning: Identifying deviations between the "intended logic" (from comments/whitepapers) and "actual implementation."
FR.3: Exploit Synthesis (The "PoC" Module)
 * Generate a Local Setup Guide (Step-by-step shell commands).
 * Generate Unit Tests for the "Happy Path."
 * Generate Exploit Tests that assert a successful attack (e.g., balance changes, unauthorized state shifts).
FR.4: Professional Reporting
 * Generate a Markdown report formatted for Immunefi and HackerOne standards, including:
   * Description & Impact.
   * Step-by-step reproduction.
   * Remediation advice.
5. Technical Specifications (Node.js/TypeScript)
A. Ingestion Tier
 * Technology: Node.js fs module with a recursive crawler.
 * Optimization: Token counting logic to ensure the bundle stays within Gemini's 1M token limit while prioritizing core logic files.
B. Analysis Tier (Gemini 3 Flash)
 * Model: gemini-3-flash.
 * Configuration: temperature: 0.1 (to ensure code accuracy) and topP: 0.95.
 * System Instructions: Role-play as a "Senior Security Researcher & DevOps Engineer."
C. Output Tier
 * Verification: A secondary "Correction Loop" where the AI checks its own generated PoC for compilation errors before final output.
6. Proposed Roadmap (4-Week Challenge)
 * Week 1 (Infrastructure): Build the Node.js/TS bundler and basic Gemini API integration.
 * Week 2 (The Audit Engine): Develop specialized prompts for SVM, EVM, and Web2 vulnerability detection.
 * Week 3 (The PoC Factory): Implement logic for the AI to generate Foundry, Anchor, and Hardhat test files.
 * Week 4 (UX & Submission): Build a CLI interface and generate the demonstration video for Devpost.
7. Competitive Advantage for the Challenge
 * Context Breadth: Showing Gemini "reading" 10,000 lines of code at once to find a single variable leak.
 * Multimodality: Adding a feature to scan Whitepaper PDFs to find "Documentation vs. Implementation" gaps.
 * Agentic Behavior: Not just a scanner, but a tool that "builds" the test environment for the human auditor.
Would you like me to create the TypeScript Interfaces for the "Security Report" so the AI's output is always structured and easy to parse?
